# transitfit

This package harnesses [kplr](github.com/dfm/kplr) and [transit](github.com/dfm/transit) in the service of Pythonic transit modeling made super-easy (and super-duper-easy for *Kepler* data).  Check out the [demo notebook](https://github.com/timothydmorton/transit-fitting/blob/master/notebooks/demo.ipynb) for a quick look.  

[n.b., at present, this will only work with [my fork of `transit`](github.com/timothydmorton/transit).]
