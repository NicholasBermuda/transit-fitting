Fitting transiting planet signals

This package harnesses [kplr](github.com/dfm/kplr) and [transit](github.com/dfm/transit) in the service of Pythonic transit modeling.  Check out the [demo notebook](https://github.com/timothydmorton/transit-fitting/blob/master/notebooks/demo.ipynb) for a quick look.
